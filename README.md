# IAP-S1-2023

#This course is designed for students with no prior programming experience. The course introduces the fundamental concepts of procedural programming, with a focus on approaches to programming including scripting languages. Topics include algorithms and problem solving, data types, control structures, functions, lists, files, and the mechanics of running, testing, and debugging. The course also offers an introduction to the ethical, historical, and social context of computing. We will use Python (version 3.X) as our programming language.

#This is a 3-credit course and you are expected to spend ~10 hours per week on the course. There will be NO final exam. There is NO hurdle component.
